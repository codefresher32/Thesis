### Title: Road Accident Risk Prediction Using Edge Computing Framework

### Description:
As predicting road accident is a time sensitive task, we used edge computing rather than
cloud computing. Because of using edge computing, the performance of machine learning
model in time complexity improves greatly. The accuracy of machine learning model is also close to those models which was developed
using cloud computing.
